               <p style="margin-top: 30px !important; margin-bottom: 60px;">The objective of our project was to make a game using Scratch. My role in the project was to develop the game and fix bugs alongside my partner. I was in charge of the formatting of the screens and other aspects of the game. I learned to number your versions of the game and how to effectively communicate with groups members since this was something I was lacking and was crucial for the project. Some challenges I overcame were procrastination and communication errors. Some teamwork skills I used were effective through communication, through e-mail or talking in person, dividing the workload to suit each others needs, and to work with someone effectively. This game uses logic-based code to make it more challenging. To play click the green flag, start, and then once more anywhere in the game, use up and down keys to dodge fireballs. Click the green flag to play again.</p>

               <p>Project: Color-Hex<br>Course: CSE (Computer Science & Engineering)<br>Duration: One month (October 2017)<br>Type of Project: Partner</p>
               <p style="float: right;">The objective of this app was to make an app/game using MIT App Inventor. My role in this project was to do the programming, the logic aspect of the game,and develop the features. I learned to be careful and double-check everything when doing a project, by making mistakes, but learning from them to make my game better. Some challenges I overcame were how to track the color rotating square, and communication errors between my parter and I. Some team work skills used for this project were communication, working hard, and coming with a plan ahead of the due-date.</p>

               <p style="margin-top: 3.5% !important;">The objective of our project was to manipuate images using Python. My role in the project was to develop most of the code and fix bugs. I was in charge of the devlopment of code and fixing bugs. I learned to make meaningful names for variables and images so you don't get confused later and how to number your versions of the game and how to effectively express what you need your partner to do, and it was useful since I felt like I didn't know what to say to them. Some challenges I overcame were related to time-mangement and preparing. Teamwork skills I used were planning, like knowning how and what to do in the given time period, and understanding and using code from someone else, I needed to learn how to use certain modules and "commands" I didn't know. Pixelate will manipuate any image you give it. On the left are examples of images from Pixelate</p>
